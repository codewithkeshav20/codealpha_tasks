# Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## Project Overview
This project builds a simple machine learning model to predict the presence of a disease based on patient medical data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., and a target label indicating disease presence (1) or absence (0).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
